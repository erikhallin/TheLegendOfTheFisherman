The Legend of the Fisherman

This game is about a fisherman, and his friends, who need to survive against 
an onslaught of slime creatures. To do this, he must equip a fish and slap 
those slimey bastards back from whence they came.

Sadly, fish don't hang around on the ground. You yourself must reel 
them in from the lake using your trusted fishing rod. You do this by 
getting up by the water and pushing the interact button when the 
water starts rippling. When the bar at the top shows up then you 
must spam the interact button to reel the fish in.

Fish can be used in more ways than just a weapon. You could eat the 
fish and regain some lost health, or you could sell the fish at the 
computer (don't ask why). When you sell the fish you gain gold, and 
that gold can be used for upgrades, such as a better fishing rod or a boat.
